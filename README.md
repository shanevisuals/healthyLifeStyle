# University Project - Healthy Lifestyle

This is a university project developed as part of my coursework. The focus of the project was to help provide users helpful information, in regards to achieving a healthier lifestyle, 
including topics such as nutrition, exercise, and mental wellness. 

### Tools Used:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript 

### Notes & Challenges
One of the main challenges during development was refining the styling and layout to achieve a consistent, professional look. 
While functional, some visual elements remain a work in progress due to time constraints and some CSS misalignments.
